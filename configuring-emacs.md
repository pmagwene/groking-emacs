# Initialization files

 * Here's a quote from the Emacs manual re: init files
 
> When Emacs is started, it normally tries to load a Lisp program from an initialization file, or init file for short. This file, if it exists, specifies how to initialize Emacs for you. Emacs looks for your init file using the filenames ~/.emacs, ~/.emacs.el, or ~/.emacs.d/init.el; you can choose to use any one of these three names (see Find Init). Here, ~/ stands for your home directory.

 * I'm using `~/emacs.d/init.el` which seems to be the more modern version.
 
 
 
# Examining values of variables
  
 * To find what value a variable is set to do: C-h v varname RET
 * To set value of a variable: M-x set-variable RET var RET value RET
