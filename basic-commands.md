# Terminology

 * `C-x` -- Control-x
 * `M-x` -- Meta-x, i.e Alt(option)-x or <Esc> followed by x
 
# Help! I'm stuck

If you're stuck at a prompt or there's a long running process you can try the following:

 * Repeatedly type `C-g`
 * Hit the `<Esc>` key multiple times

# How do I quit?

 * `C-x C-c` (or command-Q on OS X gui version)
 * On OS X 
     - `command-W` closes a window (frame in Emacs parlance)
     - `command-K` kills a buffer
   
# Getting help

 * Built in tutorial: `C-h t`
 * Official manual: `C-h r` ([Online Version](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/))
 

# Some useful commands

 * `C-v` move forward one screen
 * `M-v` move backward one screen
 * `C-l` clear screen and redisplay text (cycle cursor center->top->bottom)
 * `M->` move to end of document
 * `M-<` move to beginning of document
 
 
# vim like key bindings

I like vim because it allows effective navigating from the home row. There are a number of vi/vim modes available for Emacs, including -- viper (available by default), vimpulse (no longer in development), and [evil](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil)

 * I'm currently experimenting with evil, which seems pretty good!
