# Initialization files

 * Here's a quote from the Emacs manual re: init files
 
> When Emacs is started, it normally tries to load a Lisp program from an initialization file, or init file for short. This file, if it exists, specifies how to initialize Emacs for you. Emacs looks for your init file using the filenames ~/.emacs, ~/.emacs.el, or ~/.emacs.d/init.el; you can choose to use any one of these three names (see Find Init). Here, ~/ stands for your home directory.

 * I'm using `~/emacs.d/init.el` which seems to be the more modern version.
 
 
# vim like key bindings

 * I like vim because it allows effective navigating from the home row
 
 * There are a number of vi/vim modes available for Emacs, including -- viper (default), vimpulse (no longer in development), and [evil](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil)

 * I'm currently experimenting with evil, which seems pretty good!
